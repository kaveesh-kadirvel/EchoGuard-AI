# 🚨 EchoGuard AI

### *India’s Real-time Emotionally Intelligent Misinformation Sentinel*

EchoGuard is an **autonomous Agentic AI system** built to detect, analyze, and neutralize misinformation *before it goes viral*.
Unlike traditional fact-checkers, EchoGuard understands the **emotional triggers**—fear, anger, confusion—that fuel misinformation and amplify its spread during crises.

EchoGuard does **Sense → Think → Act** in a fully automated loop to protect digital ecosystems from panic, hostility, and false narratives.

---

## 🔥 Why EchoGuard?

During crises, misinformation spreads faster than facts because it rides on human emotions.
Conventional fact-checking systems only verify claims.
They **fail to understand the psychological triggers** that make misinformation explode.

EchoGuard solves this by blending:

* **Real-time fact verification**
* **Emotional intelligence (Fear / Anger / Confusion detection)**
* **Autonomous agentic decision-making**

The result: *emotion-aware, calming, de-escalating responses* delivered directly at the misinformation source.

---

## 🧠 EchoGuard Architecture

EchoGuard operates through a continuous three-stage loop:

### **1. SENSE**

* Monitors platforms like X (Twitter) in real time
* Detects emerging misinformation patterns using virality scoring
* Connects to verified sources (WHO, Reuters, PIB, official datasets)
* Tracks engagement signals to prioritize urgent misinformation

### **2. THINK**

Dual-layer analysis:

#### ✔ Fact Verification (RAG)

Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to pull evidence from trusted knowledge bases.

#### ✔ Emotion Analysis

Classifies posts into:

* **Fear** → Panic-driven posts
* **Anger** → Hostility, blame, rage
* **Confusion** → Lack of clarity, misinterpretation

This helps EchoGuard understand *why* misinformation is spreading.

### **3. ACT**

EchoGuard responds autonomously with psychologically tailored messaging:

| Emotion       | Response Style                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Fear**      | Calming, empathetic, reassuring + verified facts |
| **Anger**     | Firm, respectful, de-escalating                  |
| **Confusion** | Clear, step-by-step explanations                 |

All responses are factual, concise, and crafted to defuse emotional triggers.
